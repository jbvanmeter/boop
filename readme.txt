// BOOP! //

This is a virtual "whack-a-mole" game I developed for my son in-between coding bootcamp courses at the beginning of September 2021. It is written entirely in Vanilla JavaScript and HTML. As a result, it relies heavily on setInterval, clearIntervel, and setTimeout commands to achieve forwards progression in the animations and gameplay.

All games last 30 seconds. Each time a face is "booped" in the grid, the player earns a point. If the player "boops" a bomb instead, the game is over.

Additional Details:

It incorporates three different difficulty levels:

• Easy -- The faces/bombs that appear in the whack-a-mole grid disappear and regenerate every 1.3 seconds. The odds that a bomb will appear instead of a face are 1 in 10.

• Medium -- The faces/bombs that appear in the whack-a-mole grid disappear and regenerate every second. The odds that a bomb will appear instead of a face are 1 in 5.

• Hard -- The faces/bombs that appear in the whack-a-mole grid disappear and regenerate every 0.7 seconds. The odds that a bomb will appear instead of a face are 1 in 3.
